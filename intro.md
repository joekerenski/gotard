#   Anatomy of a Web App

We do not deal wholesale in generalizations.
A generalization in software is called an abstraction.
Rule of thumb: you do not abstract from something you dont understand.
I may not be able to build a microwave, but I know (almost) exactly how it 
works and when to use it instead of the oven. 

If you can wield the abstraction most of the time while knowing 
how to "step down" the ladder, you are fine. You are not a tourist.
You know the house, from cellar to roof. 

Web dev is the mother of all abstractions, not the least because of the browser.

Gooner is a handmade solution to give me an edge toward app completion. As
such, the code needs to be understandable and simple. We do not apply
industry-scale "best practices" here. Many PLT-Types will dismiss our use of Go
as inexcusabel slop. However, we are not aiming for.
But as always: You cannot say success without the suck.

I may rewrite this later in Odin or Jai, if it ever releases. For now, this is
my first attempt at freedom. I won't try Rust since I don't like a language for
insufferable pedants and petulant nitpickers. The borrow checker will not take
my freedom to make instructive mistakes. Happy little accidents. It's all true.
... not a bad language, but the natural habitat of petulant PLT types and truly
obnoxious pedants, who will belabour the comma. I wonder what all the normal
software engineers are thinking while just wanting to write code in peace.
